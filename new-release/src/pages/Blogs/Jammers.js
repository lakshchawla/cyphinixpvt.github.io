            How Hackers can jam cell phone signals?
          </h1>
          <p>
            Mobile phones are used for a variety of purposes, such as keeping in
            touch with family members, for conducting business, and in order to
            have access to a telephone in the event of an emergency. Some people
            carry more than one mobile phone for different purposes, such as for
            business and personal use.

          <h5 class="mt-3 mb-2">What is cellphone jammer? How it works? </h5>
          <p>
            A Mobile Jammer Circuit or a Cell Phone Jammer Circuit is an
            instrument or device that can prevent the reception of signals by
            Mobile Phones. Basically, a Mobile Jammer Circuit is an RF
            Transmitter, which broadcasts Radio Signals in the same (or similar)
            frequency range of the GSM Communication.
          </p>
          <p class="text-warning">
            WARNING: Blocking or Jamming Radio Signals is illegal in most
            countries. Check your local laws before using such devices.

            What are the real purposes of using cell phone jammers?
          </h5>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Cellphone jammers are typically used in places where for either
                purposes of security or forced mobile silence - mobile signals
                are jammed preventing them from ringing.
              </li>
              <li>
                VVIP movements have cellphone jammers in their vehicles and at
                the venue where the VVIP is present. This is to thwart off
                remotely trigged bombs, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Banks use it in their main cash lobbies to avoid would be
                robbers communicating with the outside accomplices.
              </li>
              <li>
                Convention centers use it where they are sick and tired of
                asking everyone to switch their mobile phones off (easier to jam
                the signal)
              </li>
              <li>
                In some specialized examples hospitals use it - in CCU/ICU
              </li>
              <li>
                Some countries have rules federated by their Telecommunication
                authorities as to where and when a cellphone jammer can be used.
                Irresponsible use of cellphone jammers can play havoc with a
                cellphone carrier's coverage maps.
